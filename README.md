# Constructor-Hangman

This command line application uses to constructors and the inqurirer node module to create a simple hangman game. Random words or phrases are chosen from an array and displayed as underscores, and the user is prompted to guess a letter. If the user submits a valid and correct letter, the appropriate letter appears in place of the underscore. If the letter is incorrect, the user loses a guess. Users win after guessing all the correct letters of a word or phrase, after which a new random word or phrase is chosen and displayed and the user is prompted to be begin guessing again. The game ends when the user runs out of guesses.
